# Tyler's AutoHotkey Scripts

> Disclaimer: These scripts are developed with AutoHotkeyV2 in mind, using AHKv2 syntax. Do not expect them to work if you only have AHKv1 installed.

My personal collection of AutoHotkeyV2 scripts, including:

* Highly-reachable directional keybinds for users with 60% keyboards that lack arrow keys
* Both automated and GUI-based utilities for emptying the contents of folders Internet Download Manager creates inside ~/Downloads/
* And more
